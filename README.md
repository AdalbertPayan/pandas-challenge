In this project undertaken during my Data Analytics and Visualization boot camp, I worked extensively with real-time data, akin to what a Chief Data Scientist might handle. In this capacity, I played a vital role in informing strategic decisions related to school budgets and priorities for the city's school district. My primary task involved in-depth analysis of district-wide standardized test results, which included math and reading scores for all students and various school-related data. I successfully aggregated and interpreted this data to uncover significant trends in school performance.
